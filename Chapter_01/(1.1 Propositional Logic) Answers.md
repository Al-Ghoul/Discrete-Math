1. Which of these sentences are propositions? What are the
truth values of those that are propositions?

| #        | Proposition | Is Proposition? | Truth Value |
|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-----:| :-----:|
| a | Boston is the capital of Massachusetts.   | Yes | T |
| b | Miami is the capital of Florida.          | Yes | F |
| c | 2 + 3 = 5                                 | Yes | T |
| d | 5 + 7 = 10                                | Yes | F |
| e | x + 2 = 11.                               | No |  |
| f | Answer this question.                     | No |  |

e is not a proposition because it has two truth values depending on the value of variable 'x' in this context.

f is also not a proposition, it is NOT a declarative statement
___

2. Which of these are propositions? What are the truth values
of those that are propositions?

| #        | Proposition | Is Proposition? | Truth Value |
|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-----:| :-----:|
| a | Do not pass go..   | No |  |
| b | What time is it?          | No |  |
| c | There are no black flies in Maine. | Yes | F |
| d | 4 + x = 5.                               | No |  |
| e | The moon is made of green cheese. | Yes | F |
| f | 2n ≥ 100.                    | No |  |


**a** is NOT a proposition, it is NOT a declarative statement.

**b** is NOT a proposition, it is NOT a declarative statement (it is a question)

**d** is NOT a proposition, it has two truth values depending on the value of variable 'x' in this context.

**f** is NOT a proposition, it has two truth values depending on the value of variable 'n' in this context.

6. Suppose that Smartphones A, B and C have the following specs :-

| #        | RAM | ROM | Camera Resolution | 
|:-------------:|-------------|-----|-----|
| A | 256 MB | 32 GB | 8 MP
| B | 288 MB | 64 GB | 4 MP
| C | 128 MB | 32 GB | 5 MP

Determine the truth value of each of
the following propositions.

a) Smartphone B has the most RAM of these three smartphones.

*p = Smartphone B has the most RAM.*

| # | p |Truth Value 
|:-------------:|-----
| a | T | T

b) Smartphone C has more ROM or a higher resolution
camera than Smartphone B.

*p = Smartphone C has more ROM than Smartphone B.*<br />
*q = Smartphone C has a higher resolution camera than Smartphone B.*

| # | p | q | p ∨ q | Truth Value 
|:-------------:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| b | F | T | T | T

c) Smartphone B has more RAM, more ROM, and a
higher resolution camera than Smartphone A.

*p = Smartphone B has more RAM than Smartphone A.*<br />
*q = Smartphone B has more ROM than Smartphone A.*<br />
*s = Smartphone B has more higher resolution than Smartphone A.*<br />
| # | p | q | s | p ∧ q ∧ s | Truth Value 
|:-------------:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| b | T | T | F | F | F

d) If Smartphone B has more RAM and more ROM than
Smartphone C, then it also has a higher resolution
camera.

*p = Smartphone B has more RAM than Smartphone C*<br />
*q = Smartphone B has more ROM than Smartphone C*<br />
*s = Smartphone B has higher resolution camera.*

| # | p | q | s | (p ∧ q) → s | Truth Value 
|:-------------:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| b | T | T | F | F | F

e) Smartphone A has more RAM than Smartphone B if
and only if Smartphone B has more RAM than Smartphone A.

*p = Smartphone A has more RAM than Smartphone B*<br />
*q = Smartphone B has more RAM than Smartphone A*

| # | p | q | p ↔ q | Truth Value 
|:-------------:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| b | F | T | F | F
