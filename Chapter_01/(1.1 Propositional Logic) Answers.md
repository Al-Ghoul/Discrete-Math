1. Which of these sentences are propositions? What are the
truth values of those that are propositions?

| #        | Proposition | Is Proposition? | Truth Value |
|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-----:| :-----:|
| a | Boston is the capital of Massachusetts.   | Yes | True |
| b | Miami is the capital of Florida.          | Yes | False |

| f | Answer this question.                     | No |  |

e is not a proposition because it has two truth values depending on the value of variable 'x' in this context.

f is also not a proposition, it is NOT a declarative statement
